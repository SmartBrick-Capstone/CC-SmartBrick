# CC-SmartBrick
Welcome to SmartBrick! 
This is an innovative application that uses plastic waste detection technology to help mitigate negative environmental impacts. The Cloud Computing part of the project is instrumental in managing and analyzing the data collected by the detection sensors on the SmartBrick. We use cloud services to securely store sensor data, perform predictive analysis processes, and present relevant information to users through a user-friendly interface. This repository contains the source code and documentation required to run the cloud infrastructure that powers the SmartBrick application. Please explore and contribute to making this solution even more powerful and sustainable!
